          The Design of Everyday Things is one of the bestselling books
          available on Amazon written by Don Norman. The book aims to educate
          people more on the inborn qualities of user-friendly design and how
          the process of construction from scratch actually takes place. It is
          considered to be one of those books that influence world thinking
          patterns.
